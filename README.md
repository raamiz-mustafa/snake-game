This was an interesting game to make as i learned many new ways to actually create the snake and get it moving.
My first big problem was learning how to actually make snake as i had previously learned to use the pygame.Rect() function, i made a simple version of snake with it where the snake could not grow so i had to change up how to actually create it, i had to make it a list containg its x and y postions and make the snake later using pygame.draw.rect with and "*" on the 3 argument to allow me to place it with the other missing arguments.
When i created the system of the snakes movement and the food disapearing and randmomly regenerating after you eat it system, i had to make a button for the games start as it would immediately put you in with the snake moving and little time to react, and it would be cleaner. I had to make it using the event handler checking if the event was mousebuttondown while the colliderect funtion checked if the mouse was on the button or not to allow it to go to the game.
A helpful thing was gamestates as i could put if statements checking to see what state the game was in, playing or menu so i would not have clutter on the screen with the snake and the button on at the same time and it was also easy to implement a pause feautur ewith gamestates as i could check if a person pressed esc and then switch gamestate to menu whcih would be the button system and would wourk like a resume feauture.
